Introductory example - Finding Model Data
=========================================

Often you are interested in plotting data relevant to a model. For example, for
some kind of clustering that maintains a group of centroids, you might want to
generate a plot of those centroids.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-16

.. code-block:: default


    from river import feature_extraction, cluster, stream
    from sklearn import datasets
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-19

Here we want to generate a clustering and view the centroids. This is a static
visualization because the plot will not change in real time.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-26

.. code-block:: default


    model = cluster.DBSTREAM()
    dataset = datasets.load_iris()
    for x, _ in stream.iter_sklearn_dataset(dataset):
       model.learn_one(x=x)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-29

We will run all the points through the prediction first to force
populating the clusters.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-32

.. code-block:: default

    for x, _ in stream.iter_sklearn_dataset(dataset):
       model.predict_one(x=x)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-36

When you want to find centers for a cluster model, they will usually be at 
models.centers. If you have a pipeline, you will need ot look at ``model.steps``
and index your model name (e.g., DBSTREAM) to find the same.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-39

.. code-block:: default


    centers = model.centers








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-43

Here is the most basic example of choosing two features and plotting them 
against x and y. You could also use TSNE and UMAP (provided in other examples)
to map the centers to a lower 2D space and do the same.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-64

.. code-block:: default


    features = ['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']

    # Prepare subplots!
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 4, figsize=(12, 12), sharey=True)
    idxs = [(i,j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4)]

    for f1 in features:
        for f2 in features:  
            x = [d[f1] for _, d in centers.items()]
            y = [d[f2] for _, d in centers.items()]
            idx = idxs.pop(0)
            axis = axs[idx[0]][idx[1]]
            axis.scatter(x, y)
            axis.set_xlabel(f1)
            axis.set_ylabel(f2)

    fig.show()
